# End of support

```
Step 1: Setup everything
Add the generated root CA certificate to trusted root certificates

Double-click on rootCA.crt
Click "Install certificate"
Select "Local Machine," then click "Next"
Select "Place all certificates in the following store," click "Browse" and select "Trusted Root Certification"
Click "Finish" ( only needed to do 1 time )
Same thing for keyauth.win.crt Certificate but Just pressing next works fine ( also 1 time also )

Both of them are in the Folder x64/Release/certs

Now please install the OpenSSL 3.3.2 Windows Installer.

Step 2: Obtain application secret
Example of doing so: https://player.vimeo.com/video/1006943145

you can use regex ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{64}$ to show only strings that match with the secret format.

Step 3: Run it

Once everything is done run Emulator.exe.

if everything worked fine and you got no errors then procced to open the Keyauth Loader
